# TDD To Do List #

## Search ##
* the search text box populates as I type (use Ajax?)

## Add Connection ##
* reformat the fields into a row
* put more spacing between the nodes and connections
* When entering a new connection the fields populate as I type with existing nodes and connection names
* If can enter node names with commas then I get multiple nodes with same connection
* If I enter commas in subject and target nodes then I get a cross-product of connections
* 
## Connections to a Node ##
* make the table grid invisible

## Delete Connections ##
* I can delete all connections displayed

## Delete Nodes ##
* I can delete a node
* I get warned about the number of connections deleted when deleting a node

## Edit Connection ##
* I can edit a connection name that alters all connections with that name

## Edit Node ##
* I can edit a single node name which will alter just that connection
* I can edit a node name that will make a global change to all nodes with that name

## Done ##
*[x] Create hidden links to purge database and load test data 
*[x] I can search for nodes and connection names in the same text box
*[x] Search results separate tables for nodes name matches and connection name matches
*[x] reuse the same layout as on Add Connection
*[x] I can delete a connection
*[x] I can delete multiple connections
*[x] Only selected connections get deleted
*[x] I can edit a single connection name that alters just that connection
